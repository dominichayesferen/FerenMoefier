# Feren Moefier
Transform your Linux-based Operating System into a Moefied beauty with the help of a script, a bunch of Moebuntu resources and some extras.

Feren Moefier is a tool by The Feren OS Developer that does what it says on the tin - Moefies the Operating System you run it on. It supports Budgie, Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE Plasma, Pantheon, UKUI, Unity, XFCE and potentially even more Desktop Environments! It's essentially a Moebuntu script but with some extras.

Tested distributions include Ubuntu, Feren OS, Feren OS Classic, Linux Mint, Linux Lite, elementary OS, Fedora Linux, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Kylin, and Ubuntu Unity Remix.

This was made purely out of fun and is NOT designed to be, in any way, malicious. It will make permanent modifications to your Operating System, but the only modifications it does are to aid in the moeification.

Requires an internet connection to download all the necessary resources when running the script.

<h2>Translating Feren Moefier</h2>
Translating Feren Moefier is now possible. Just open the supplied .pot file in a program like Poedit and translate to your heart's content. All I ask is that you save the .po and .mo that get generated to translations/THE LOCALE/LC_MESSAGES/ when Pull Requesting the translations, and to keep the translations faithful to the original messages. They're written in English (UK), just for the record.
